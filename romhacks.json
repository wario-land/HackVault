I haven't gotten to the last stage yet, but I think it might be the easiest stage, because you dont have to jump over spikes as much as the original. Due to it's difficulty, I extended the time to about 10 minutes to all :Normal:, :Hard:, & :SHard:. If you want to challenge yourself, reduce the time in the maker. NOTE: In order to try out the level, you must have access to the Golden Passage.",
